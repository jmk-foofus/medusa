<P>
Medusa is intended to be a speedy, massively parallel, modular, login brute-forcer.
The goal is to support as many services which allow remote authentication as
possible. The author considers following items as some of the key features of this
application:

<UL>
  <LI><B>Thread-based parallel testing.</B> Brute-force testing can be performed against multiple
hosts, users or passwords concurrently.

  <LI><B>Flexible user input.</B> Target information (host/user/password) can be specified in
a variety of ways. For example, each item can be either a single entry or a file 
containing multiple entries. Additionally, a combination file format allows the user 
to refine their target listing.

  <LI><B>Modular design.</B> Each service module exists as an independent .mod file. This means
that no modifications are necessary to the core application in order to extend the supported list 
of services for brute-forcing.
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="why">Why?</A></H2>

<P>
Why create Medusa? Isn't this the same thing as <A HREF="http://www.thc.org/thc-hydra">THC-Hydra</A>? Here are some
of the reasons for this application:

<UL>
  <LI><B>Application stability.</B> Maybe I'm just lame, but Hydra frequently crashed on me. I
was no longer confident that Hydra was actually doing what it claimed to be. Rather
than fix Hydra, I decided to create my own buggy application which could crash in
new and exciting ways.

  <LI><B>Code organization.</B> A while back I added several features to Hydra (parallel host
scanning, SMBNT module). Retro-fitting the parallel host code to Hydra was a serious
pain. This was mainly due to my coding ignorance, but was probably also due to
Hydra not being designed from the ground-up to support this. Medusa was designed from
the start to support parallel testing of hosts, users and passwords.

  <LI><B>Speed.</B> Hydra accomplishes its parallel testing by forking off a new process for
each host and instance of the service being tested. When testing many hosts/users at once this 
creates a large amount of overhead as user/password lists must be duplicated for each forked 
process. Medusa is pthread-based and does not unnecessarily duplicate information.

  <LI><B>Education.</B> I am not an experienced C programmer, nor do I consider myself an
expert in multi-threaded programming. Writing this application was a training
exercise for me. Hopefully, the results of it will be useful for others.

How do I use this thing? Simply running "medusa" without any options will dump
all the parameters it accepts along with their respective description. Here are
several example uses:

Medusa v1.0-rc1 [http://www.foofus.net] (C) JoMo-Kun / Foofus Networks

smbnt.mod (0.1.1) JoMo-Kun :: Brute force module for SMB/NTLMv1 sessions

Available module options:
  GROUP:? (DOMAIN, LOCAL*, BOTH)
    Option sets NetBIOS workgroup field.
    DOMAIN: Check credentials against this hosts primary domain controller via this host.
    LOCAL:  Check local account.
    BOTH:   Check both. This leaves the workgroup field set blank and then attempts to check
            the credentials against the host. If the account does not exist locally on the
            host being tested, that host then queries its domain controller.
  GROUP_OTHER:?
    Option allows manual setting of domain to check against. Use instead of GROUP.
  PASS:?  (PASSWORD*, HASH, MACHINE)
    PASSWORD: Use normal password.
    HASH:     Use a NTLM hash rather than a password.
    MACHINE:  Use the machine's NetBIOS name as the password.
  NETBIOS
    Force NetBIOS Mode (Disable Native Win2000 Mode). Win2000 mode is the default.
    Default mode is to test TCP/445 using Native Win2000. If this fails, module will
    fall back to TCP/139 using NetBIOS mode. To test only TCP/139, use the following:
    medusa -M smbnt -m NETBIOS -n 139

(*) Default value
Usage example: "-M smbnt -m GROUP:DOMAIN -m PASS:HASH"

<LI><I>The following command instructs Medusa to test all passwords listed in passwords.txt
against a single user (administrator) on the host 192.168.0.20 via the SMB service. 
The "-e ns" instructs Medusa to additionally check if the administrator account has 
either a blank password or has its password set to match its username 
(administrator).</I><BR>

<LI><I>The below command-line demonstrates how to execute some of the parallel features 
of Medusa. Here at least 20 hosts and 10 users are tested concurrently. The "-L"
options instructs Medusa to parallelize by user. This means each of the 10 threads
targeting a host checks a unique user.</I><BR>

<PRE><CODE>
% medusa -H hosts.txt -U users.txt -P passwords.txt -T 20 -t 10 -L -F -M smbnt
</PRE></CODE>

<LI><I>Medusa allows host/username/password data to also be set using a "combo" file. The
combo file can be specified using the "-C" option. The file should contain one entry per
line and have the values colon separated in the format host:user:password. If any of the
three fields are left empty, the respective information should be provided either as a 
global value or as a list in a file. Medusa will perform a basic parameter check based on
the contents of the first line in the file.
</I>

<P>
<I>The following combinations are possible in the combo file:</I>
<UL>
  <LI>host:username:password
  <LI>host:username:
  <LI>host::
  <LI>:username:password
  <LI>:username:
  <LI>::password
  <LI>host::password
</UL>

<P>
<I>The following example will check each entry in the file combo.txt</I><BR>

<CODE>
% medusa -M smbnt -C combo.txt<BR>
</CODE>

<BR>
<I>The combo.txt file:</I><BR>
<CODE>
192.168.0.20:administrator:password<BR>
192.168.0.20:testuser:pass<BR>
192.168.0.30:administrator:blah<BR>
192.168.0.40:user1:foopass<BR>
</CODE>

<P>
<I>The following example will check each entry in the file combo.txt against the targets
listed in hosts.txt</I><BR>

<CODE>
% medusa -M smbnt -C combo.txt -H hosts.txt<BR>
</CODE>

<BR>
<I>The combo.txt file:</I><BR>
<CODE>
:administrator:password<BR>
:testuser:pass<BR>
:administrator:blah<BR>
:user1:foopass<BR>
</CODE>

<P>
<I>Medusa also supports using PwDump files as a combo file. The format of these files should 
be user:id:lm:ntlm:::. We look for ':::' at the end of the first line to determine if the file 
contains PwDump output.</I>

<H3>Install Instructions:</H3>

<H4>General</H4>

<P>
The majority of Medusa was written and tested on Linux/Gentoo-based systems. While it has been 
known to work on variety of operating systems, it is quite possible there may be issues that
crop up only on non-Gentoo devices. Of course, there are issues that will probably also show
up on Gentoo that have so far been missed... 

<P>
Medusa should be fairly straight-forward to build: "./configure; make; make install". However,
this may result in a somewhat limited installation. To take full advantage of all the brute-forcing 
goodness that Medusa has to offer, several dependencies must be satisfied. The following table 
lists out the modules which have additional dependencies. In order for the modules to function, 
the appropriate header files must be installed on the system when the modules themselves are 
compiled. Additional module specific information is included within the documentation for each 
module.

<P>
It should also be noted that, by default, not all of the modules are built. Incomplete modules or modules
which have not been sufficiently tested may be disabled. The "configure" output should identify which
modules it will attempt to build. To enable non-default modules, use the "--enable-module-MODULE_NAME"
configure option.

At this time Medusa is not available within Portage. An ebuild for Medusa has been submitted to
<A HREF="http://bugs.gentoo.org">bugs.gentoo.org</A>, but has not yet made its way into Portage. In 
the meantime, all of the ebuilds can be used via Portage Overlay. For example, Medusa can be installed 
via the Gentoo "pentoo" overlay located at <A HREF="http://trac.pentoo.ch/">trac.pentoo.ch</A>. Additionally,
the ebuilds have been included and can also be manually installed.

<P>

<P>
This fine piece of buggy software was brought to you by the geeks at 
<A HREF="http://www.foofus.net">Foofus.net</A>. JoMo-Kun was the chief
goon and wrote the core of Medusa along with several of the modules.
Foofus created the initial design for the loadable modules. Fizzgig 
provided the networking code, several modules, the loadable module
implementation along with also fixing a bunch JoMo-Kun's crappy stuff. 
pMonkey was a crazy module coding fiend. Last, but certainly not least, 
Heidi provided the tool's name.

<H2><A NAME="huh">Huh?</A></H2>

<P>
If you have questions regarding this application, feel free to contact us. Either 
send me email directly or join our mailing list <A HREF="http://lists.foofus.net/listinfo.cgi/foofus-tools-foofus.net">foofus-tools</A>.
If it breaks, please send a detailed bug report. Even better, send in a patch. I make no
claims that this program will do what you want it to. I've been using it during
our assessments for years now successfully. Hopefully, others will have similar
luck. If you find Medusa useful and want to give something back, please submit 
new modules, code improvements or just buy any of the <A HREF="http://www.foofus.net">
Foofus.net</A> goons a beer at the next DefCon.
