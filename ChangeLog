================================================================
Version 2.0
================================================================

Medusa Core Updates:
  -Pool-based thread handling

  Previous version destroyed threads following the completion of a host
  or user test. The use of a thread pool should decrease the overall
  application overhead by limiting the frequency of thread destruction
  and creation. The original code ran into issues in several specific
  situations (e.g. testing over a thousand users with only a single 
  password). Such cases resulted in a large number of threads being
  created and destroyed in short order, frequently resulting in an
  application crash. The thread pool should eliminate this particular
  problem.

  -Modules now request next credential set (username + password)

  Modules previously called getNextPass(), which returned a valid password
  until the password list for the user being tested was exhausted. At that
  point, the module exited and the login thread was destroyed. A new thread
  and module instance would be created for the next user to test. We now
  use getNextCredetialSet(), which returns a valid user and password. This
  allows the module to get the next user to test and decide whether the
  connection needs to be completely torn down or not.

  -Secondary user credential queue added for missed login tests.

  In certain situations we need to scale back the number of concurrent
  login threads targetting a specific service. For example, MSDE's workload
  governor limits the service to no more than 5 concurrent connections. If
  the user kicked-off 10 parallel login threads, 5 of those are going to
  fail and terminate. The challenge is that each of those threads was 
  already assigned a credential set to test.

  The previous version simply printed the username and password combinations
  which were not tested and moved on. We now push these missed credentials
  into a host specific queue. Once the login threads have finished their
  normal checks, they move on to this queue and retry the previously missed
  credentials. In some cases, say it's the last thread that pushed something
  into the queue before exiting, we kick-off a clean-up thread to walk through
  any remaining items.

  -Host and User-level Resume

  Support for host and user-level resuming of a scan. When Medusa receives a 
  SIGINT, it will calculate and display a "resume map". This map can then be
  supplied to the next run. For example, "medusa [OPTIONS PREVIOUSLY USED] 
  -Z h6u1u2h8.". This map describes which hosts were completed and which 
  systems had not been touched. If a host was partially completed, it 
  describes which users had been tested for that specific system. It should 
  be noted that password-level resuming is not supported. If a user's 
  password list was only partially completed, testing of the user will be 
  restarted on resume.

   connections (FTPS).
